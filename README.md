# pygame-snake
I created this Snake game in Python with Pygame to learn the basics of both python and pygame. I added my own kind of pixel art and created some particle animations as well. This is a good example of a basic game with pygame because it has advanced features such as a scene manager.

## Gameplay:
You are the snake and have to collect the golden apples, which makes you grow. But be careful to not run into the nukes because they will kill you!

## Menu:

The menu consists of a starting screen as well as a gameover screen that shows you the score.

## Game:

The score gets overlayed in the top left corner of the game.


## Particle animations:

Running into an apple or a nuke both leads to a particle animation. This can be seen on the screenshot above.
